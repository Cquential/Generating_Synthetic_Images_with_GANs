# Generating Synthetic Images with DCGANs in Keras

This guided project can be found [here](https://www.coursera.org/projects/generative-adversarial-networks-keras).

I have included the raw file before I worked on it as well as the final notebook. To improve upon its results:

- Increase the number of training epochs
- Increase the number of layers in the network(its Depth)
- Use Additional training samples, I only used about ~1500 samples to train on the Fashion MNIST Data

This project was easy to implement and should be easy to read as well. The purpose of my providing the raw notebook is to encourage you to create your own network.
To build further upon this, I would like to suggest going through [Soumith's repository](https://github.com/soumith/ganhacks), it contains quite a few examples and provides better theoretical understanding.

This [article](https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-develop-a-generative-adversarial-network-for-a-cifar-10-small-object-photographs-from-scratch/) was actually remarkable(imo) as I found it easy to learn and it's also a small step above just beginning to understand GANs.

Also refer to this [TDS Article](https://towardsdatascience.com/beating-the-gan-game-afbcce0a20be) to learn more about GANs and common ways to end up training for eons to acheive only errors
